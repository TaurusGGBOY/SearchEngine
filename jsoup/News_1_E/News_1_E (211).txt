Colorado the grieving father got some redemption With a razor close vote the Colorado senate voted to approve Sullivan s House Bill allowing Colorado police to take guns away from people showing signs of being a threat to themselves or others Had the law been in effect in Sullivan s son might be alive today And with Colorado Democratic Governor Jared Polis on board the new law s passage gave Sullivan the happiest moment since the worst day of his life I m not backing down I ve got nothing to lose Sullivan told Xinhua after the landmark vote In an exclusive interview the year old former postal worker turned politician told Xinhua how his son s murder triggered his political path and how gun control legislation is dominating America s political agenda PRODUCT OF PAIN Sullivan s son died on July inside a movie theater in Aurora east of Denver Alex Sullivan went there to celebrate his th birthday with a dozen friends who all worked waiting tables at a nearby Red Robin Minutes after midnight bullets sprayed into the unsuspecting crowd and the younger Sullivan was one of people killed Later that day Tom Sullivan s distraught face became a symbol of extreme agony a parent losing a child from gun violence that was broadcast from coast to coast by the U S media And on that day the elder Sullivan s life changed forever culminating in his victory on Thursday in Denver We scored a touchdown he said modestly a sports reference to a big score in football Gun control is a complex multi faceted issue and this week s legislative win in the Rocky Mountain state is just the beginning of the air force veteran s quest to save lives I lost one of the greatest gifts given to me and I don t want this to happen to anyone else Sullivan said I had no choice but to get into politics Sullivan is one of hundreds of politicians elected in by a growing sector of the electorate who used the mid term election to voice their discontent with current gun laws A total of states now have passed Extreme Risk Protection Order laws also called Red Flag laws that empower law enforcement and immediate family members to ask a judge if they can step in and remove the killing tools A majority of the new Red Flag states are in America s east in bastions of liberalism such as Massachusetts Maryland and New York where Governor Andrew Cuomo signed a bill to join the exclusive club

murder Colorado passed two modest gun control laws reducing in the size of magazines and requiring background checks but politicians supporting these measures were voted out of office in The public mood has changed Phillips told Xinhua Friday With the mass murders not stopping and millions of Americans grieving the loss of family members their pain has spilled over into the ballot box Phillips noted of the politicians voted into office last year It is so tragic it took more unnecessary deaths to get Republican politicians to listen she added GUN CONTROL IMPASSE These victories come despite National Rifle Association money that has bought and paid politicians to vote against any form of gun control Phillips said Gun control is an extremely partisan issue in the United States with Republicans generally opposing regulation for the million guns owned by Americans and Democrats unsuccessfully trying to initiate modest control measures According to a article by Followthemoney org

reducing firearm suicides by and percent respectively According to a Reuters Ipsos poll last month percent of Americans including percent of Democrats and percent of Republicans want tougher gun laws Yet the public has little confidence in lawmakers to take action SULLIVAN S PATH Since that grim day seven years ago Sullivan has not stopped Nor will he ever Sullivan is pushing for a similar safe storage bill that might have stopped the murder of elementary school children and staff in Newton Connecticut and last year s killing of students at a Parkland Florida high school where deranged teenagers got access to unsecured guns A similar gun safety bill was approved by the New York legislature earlier this month and is expected to be signed by Cuomo Tom Sullivan is a true American hero
