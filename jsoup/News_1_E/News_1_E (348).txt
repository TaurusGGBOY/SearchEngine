BALTIMORE April Xinhua Chris Davis of the Baltimore Orioles claimed Major League Baseball most unwanted record as the home team took on the Oakland Athletics here at Camden Yards on Monday night Davis broke the record previously set by Eugenio Velez who moved between two teams in the seasons after which his career in the Majors came to an end Davis is now for at bat since late last year His other stats paint an even more dire picture Davis has not had a run a hit or an RBI since September of last year His last home run was a month before that in August He has not boasted a batting average above since October Compounding fans frustration at Camden Yards is the fact that Davis is in the midst of a million U S dollar guaranteed seven year contract with the Orioles In previous games fans had taken to booing Davis but clapped for him tonight as a gesture of support Ironically the swing that sealed Davis s place in the history books was one of his better attempts and his first time making contact with the ball on three straight at bats since March In a small consolation for home fans the Orioles went on to trounce the Athletics snapping a four game losing streak Game two in their series is set for tomorrow
