WASHINGTON April Xinhua The Bloomberg Barclays Global Aggregate Index started including China s yuan demoninated bonds Monday with a month phase in period The inclusion of the bonds issued by the government and policy banks in the index is expected to attract foreign inflows into the Chinese bond market and foster a further opening up of the country s financial sector FOREIGN INFLOWS After their full inclusion Chinese renminbi RMB denominated bonds will become the fourth largest currency component following the U S dollar the euro and the Japanese yen China s weight would reach approximately percent of the index using data as of Jan this year It will effectively lead to more purchases of Chinese bonds by foreigners and provide investors globally with an opportunity to diversify their assets Alfred Schipke the International Monetary Fund IMF senior resident representative for China told Xinhua in a recent interview Goldman Sachs estimated in February that total inflows into China s bond market prompted by this inclusion would be billion U S dollars over the month scale in period Morgan Stanley meanwhile expects to see billion dollars of inflows into the government bond market in compared to billion dollars on average between and It sees as much as billion dollars going into China s government bond market annually from to according to a February report China s bond market stood at about trillion yuan trillion dollars by the end of with about trillion yuan billion dollars or percent held by global investors up percent from a year earlier according to the People s Bank of China Deutsche Bank s projections suggest that foreigners will own as much as a fifth of central government debt in five years Bloomberg reported last week An expected growth in inflows will make the foreign investor community an increasingly significant stakeholder in China s financial system Bloomberg said IMPORTANT MILESTONE The inclusion is an important milestone in China s financial integration into the world economy said Changyong Rhee director of the IMF s Asia and Pacific Department at a book forum held in Washington D C in March This development follows the establishment in of the so called Bond Connect which allows foreigners to enter the Chinese bond market as well as the authorities recent commitments to further develop and open the market Rhee said in his opening remarks at the event According to a government work report delivered in early March China will implement reform and opening up measures in the financial sectors and improve policies on opening the bond market Schipke noted that the inclusion of the renminbi RMB in the Special Drawing Rights SDR basket in November was associated with operational improvements in China s bond market which has triggered a surge in global investor interest More foreign central banks and sovereign wealth funds have bought RMB bonds as part of their reserves he said as holdings of RMB reserves by foreign central banks have gone up about percent since Citing the co movement of the RMB with other currencies in the world Schipke said the international monetary system might be moving away from the bipolar U S dollar and the euro blocs to a tripolar system That probably means that there will be additional demand for RMB bonds he said China s bond market the third largest in the world is reaching a tipping point as regulation market access investor demand and benchmarks are firmly in place Li Bing head of Bloomberg China said in a statement China s inclusion in the index has been a journey as financial reforms deepen and as its capital markets become more transparent to global investors Li said FURTHER OPENING UP Bloomberg suggested China enhance market liquidity improve its rating system increase hedging tools and address operational concerns in order to promote the healthy development of China s bond market Li said As foreign rating agencies start operating in the Chinese bond market its rating system has to improve to meet global standards Li said adding that it is critical for the next evolution of China s corporate bond inclusion into the Bloomberg Barclays index Bloomberg found it encouraging to hear that a key task for the People s Bank of China this year is to provide sufficient financial hedging instruments to allow investors to effectively manage risks Li said Goldman Sachs thinks that the operational issues should improve over time as teething issues are addressed during the phased inclusion which should pave the way for other bond indices to include China Two other major global bond indices include the FTSE World Government Bond Index and the J P Morgan Government Bond Index Emerging Markets We expect all three major bond indices to include China or at least announcement of plans to include China by the end of Goldman Sachs said in the February report Schipke one of the editors of the book The Future of China s Bond Market published by the IMF in March said the team thinks that China s financial sector integration in the next decade will bring many opportunities for investors globally to diversify their portfolios Looking ahead the book s contributors believe that a careful sequencing of reforms could help minimize risks and promote the development of China s bond market The team suggested that China strengthen the capacity of financial regulators boost foreign participation and improve communication among other things It is important to further the quantity of information that is available for investors Schipke said adding that more transparency should be conducive to the development of China s bond market Last year China celebrated its th anniversary of reform and opening up which contributed to China s trade and product integration said Schipke But if you re looking at the future our view is that the future will be about China s financial sector integration with the world and the bond market will play a particular role he said
