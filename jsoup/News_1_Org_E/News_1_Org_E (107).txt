BEIJING, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Li Zhanshu, chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People's Congress (NPC), on Friday met with a delegation of the U.S.-China Working Group from the U.S. Congress in Beijing. This year marks the 40th anniversary of the establishment of diplomatic ties between China and the United States. Li said that history has proved that cooperation is the best choice for both China and the U.S. The two sides should promote the stable development of bilateral ties and deepen mutually beneficial cooperation, Li said. He said the consensus reached by the two heads of state during their meeting in Argentina has mapped out the direction for the development of China-U.S. ties. The two sides should work together to expand cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit, control their differences on the basis of mutual respect, and actively promote the development of bilateral relations with coordination, cooperation and stability as the defining features. Hailing the contributions the U.S.-China Working Group has made in promoting exchanges between the two countries, Li said the Chinese NPC attaches great importance in strengthening exchanges with the U.S. Congress and hopes the two legislatures will pursue shared goals and contribute to deepening mutual trust and mutually beneficial cooperation. Rick Larsen and other U.S. Congressmen spoke highly of China's foreign investment law and expressed willingness to continue to play a constructive role in promoting bilateral ties.
