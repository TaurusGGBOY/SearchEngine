BEIJING, April 10 (Xinhua) -- China suffered their second consecutive defeat in the IIHF Ice Hockey Women's World Championship Division I Group B, losing 4-3 to Poland here on Wednesday in a result that paid to their hopes of promotion to Group A. China, who lost to the Netherlands on Tuesday, squandered a 1-0 lead as Poland surged 4-1 ahead after 50 minutes. Fang Xin pulled two goals back in less than one minute, but it was still not enough for the hosts. It was the perfect start for China, as Yang Liying won possession and squared for He Xin who scored the opener just 55 seconds into the game. Wiktoria Sikorska scored the leveler in the 12th minute, with the first period ending 1-1. Poland then took the lead through Karolina Pozniewska, five minutes before Wiktoria Gogoc made it 3-1. The European side took a three-goal lead 10 minutes after the start of third period, when Pozniewska's long shot made it 4-1. China then hit back as striker Fang Xin scored two in the space of one minute, but it was not quite enough to tie the game. "I am not satisfied with the second period. We lost control and made too many mistakes," said China's head coach Jakob Kolliker. In the early fixture, the Netherlands defeated Latvia 3-1, which ended China's hopes of promotion to Group A. "We need to make plans for the future. We still have a lot to do," Kolliker said. Group B's other game on Wednesday saw South Korea demolish Kazakhstan 5-1.
