BEIJING, April 15 (Xinhua) -- China on Monday urged U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo to stop stirring up troubles between China and Latin America. Pompeo has reportedly made unfriendly remarks on China and China-Latin America relations during a visit to Chile and other Latin American countries. "It's utterly irresponsible and unreasonable for U.S. Secretary of State (Mike) Pompeo to recklessly slander China and wilfully stir up troubles over China-Latin America relations. We are strongly opposed to this," Foreign Ministry Spokesperson Lu Kang told a press briefing. Cooperation between China and Latin American countries, guided by principles of mutual respect, equality, mutual benefit and win-win outcomes, focuses on common development and has made significant contributions to the economic growth and improvement of people's well-being in Latin American countries, Lu said. For a long time, the United States has regarded Latin America as its own "backyard" and has frequently pressured, threatened and even overthrown other regimes, he added. "We believe Latin American countries will make the correct judgment about who is a real friend and who is a fake one, and about who disregards rules and spreads disorder." The spokesperson also pointed out that for a long time, a number of U.S. politicians had maligned China, fanning up flames worldwide and driving a wedge between China and other countries. Calling such actions "disgraceful," Lu stressed that lies will always be lies and that "Mr. Pompeo should stop making them."
