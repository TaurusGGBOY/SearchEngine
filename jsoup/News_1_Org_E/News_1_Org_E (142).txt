WASHINGTON, March 20 (Xinhua) -- The NBA announced on Wednesday that the Chinese and Croatian national teams will join all 30 NBA teams to compete at the NBA Summer League 2019, marking the first time that the league features two international teams. The NBA Summer League will take place at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas between July 5-15. Team China previously played in Las Vegas at the NBA Summer League 2007. Team Croatia will make its NBA Summer League debut. The NBA Summer League 2019 will be an 11-day, 83-game competition that opens with all 32 teams playing four preliminary games each. The top eight teams are then seeded in a tournament, which culminates with a Championship Game on July 15. Teams that do not qualify for the tournament will each play a consolation game. Every team will play at least five games and as many as seven at the Summer League. The Portland Trail Blazers defeated the Los Angeles Lakers in the Championship Game in the Summer League 2018.
