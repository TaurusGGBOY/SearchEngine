TRIPOLI, April 17 (Xinhua) -- A total of 189 people have been killed and 816 others wounded in the fighting between the UN-backed Libyan government and the east-based army in and around the capital Tripoli so far, the World Health Organization (WHO) said on Wednesday. "In the conflict in Tripoli, Libya, 189 are dead and 816 are wounded. More than 18,000 people are displaced," WHO said in a statement. "WHO and health partners are coordinating mobile medical teams that are going to centers for the displaced people and treating the sick," the statement added. The east-based army, led by Khalifa Haftar, has been leading a military campaign since early April to take over Tripoli, where the UN-backed government is based. Libya has been struggling to make a democratic transition amid insecurity and chaos ever since the fall of former leader Muammar Gaddafi's regime in 2011.
