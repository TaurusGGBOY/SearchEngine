BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Around 9.78 million Chinese visited cemeteries to honor their deceased relatives during the three-day holiday for Tomb-sweeping Day, which lasts from Friday to Sunday. The figure, slightly more than 9.73 million people visiting burial sites last year, was based on the figures collected from 180 observation stations set up across the country, according to the Ministry of Civil Affairs. Local authorities and funeral service institutions carried out safety management measures and no severe accidents were reported during the holiday, according to the ministry. Tomb-sweeping Day, also known as Qingming Festival, is the most important occasion for Chinese to honor their ancestors. People usually pay respects to their ancestors and departed family members by setting symbolic objects alight.
