SANAA, March 31 (Xinhua) -- At least 13 soldiers and dozens of Houthi rebels were killed in clashes in Yemen's southern province of Dhalea on Sunday, a government source said. Fighting raged after the rebels seized control over several sites three days ago in the north of Dhalea, about 245 km south of rebel-held capital Sanaa. Sunday's clashes led the troops to recapture the sites from the rebels after heavy losses of the militias, the source told Xinhua by phone on condition of anonymity. Yemen has been plagued by a civil war since late 2014 after Houthi rebels revolted against the Saudi-backed internationally recognized government of President Abd-Rabbu Mansour Hadi. The rebels advanced from their far northern stronghold of Saada province towards the south, seizing control over much of the country's north, including the capital Sanaa, which triggered the most deadly war.
