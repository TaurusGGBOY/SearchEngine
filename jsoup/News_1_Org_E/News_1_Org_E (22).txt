RIO DE JANEIRO, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Atletico Mineiro sacked coach Levir Culpi following the team's 4-1 Copa Libertadores loss to Cerro Porteno, the Brazilian club said on Thursday. Wednesday night's result was Atletico's third loss in four games and left the Belo Horizonte side on the brink of elimination from South American football's top club competition. "I was called into a meeting with the president (Sergio Sette) and from today I'm no longer Atletico's head coach. It leaves me with a bad feeling," Culpi told Globo Esporte. Atletico said in a statement that assistant coach Luiz Roberto Matter had also left the club. Culpi led the 2013 Copa Libertadores champions to 18 wins, five draws and eight losses after taking charge in October last year. Atletico have won just one of their four 2019 Copa Libertadores matches and need victories in both of their remaining two group fixtures to have any chance of progressing to the knockout phase.
