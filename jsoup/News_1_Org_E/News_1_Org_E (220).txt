BEIJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Musical "The Tune of Water" will hit the stage at the Beijing Tianqiao Performing Arts Center on Saturday. It is based on the folklore of Xiangxi, Hunan Province, especially the Miao ethnic group. Audiences will enjoy romantic songs that express the affection between lovers in ancient Xiangxi who were separated by mountains and rivers. Times have changed. The natural barriers pose no more obstacles, but the songs have survived and thrived as a distinctive form of Hunan folk art. The musical is part of an art festival hosted by the center from March to June.
