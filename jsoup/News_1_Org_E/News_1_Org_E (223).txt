PARIS, April 17 (Xinhua) -- For its 72nd session, Cannes Film Festival will award French veteran actror Alain Delon with an Honorary Palme d'or "to pay tribute to his wonderful presence in the history of film," organizers said on Wednesday. Cannes Festival is proud and delighted that the legendary actor who starred in Luchino Visconti's "The Leopard" (Palme d'or, 1963) has accepted this honour from the international community, it said in a statement. Regarded as a living legend and a global icon, the 83-year-old "giant" has starred in more than 80 films and worked with some of the world's most famous filmmakers in countless masterpieces. Delon's relationship with the festival dates back to the start of his career, with the premiere of "The Joy of Living" in 1961. He was back on the Croisette several times notably for "The Eclipse" in 1962, "The Leopard" in 1963 and "Mr. Klein" in 1976. "Pierre Lescure and I are delighted that Alain Delon has accepted to be honoured by the Festival," said Thierry Fremaux, general delegate of the Festival. Delon hesitated for a long time, having long been reluctant to this Palme d'or because he thought he should only come to Cannes to celebrate the directors he had been working with, the statement added. Jeanne Moreau, Woody Allen, Bernardo Bertolucci, Jane Fonda, Clint Eastwood, Jean-Paul Belmondo, Manoel de Oliveira, Agnes Varda and Jean-Pierre Leaud had been honored by the Festival. The 72nd edition of the glamorous French Riviera festival will kick off on May 14. Chaired by Mexican film director Alejandro Gonzalez Inarritu, the jury will present the Palme d'Or at the closing ceremony on May 25.
