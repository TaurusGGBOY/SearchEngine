NANJING, April 4 (Xinhua) -- Ghana Black Queens captain Elizabeth Addo has penned a deal with Chinese Women's Super League outfit Jiangsu Suning for the 2019 season, the club said Thursday. Addo signed a one-year deal with Jiangsu Suning women's team on a free transfer, joining South Africa's Linda Motlhalo and Chrestinah Thembi Kgatlana and Nigeria's Francisca Ordega and becoming the fourth African player to move to the Chinese Women's Super League in 2019. The 26-year-old midfielder had spent the 2018 season with Australian Women's League side Western Sydney Wanderers, on loan from American National Women's League side Seattle Reign. She will reunite with her former Kvarnsvedens teammate and Malawian star Tabitha Chawinga. Addo captained the Black Queens in the 2018 African Women Cup of Nations (AWCON) hosted by Ghana and she was named in the Best XI of the 2018 AWCON despite exiting the group stage.
