AUGUSTA, United States, April 9 (Xinhua) -- Golf legend Tiger Woods of the United States will begin his 22nd Masters campaign on Thursday and will play alongside China's Li Haotong and Spain's Jon Rahm for the first two rounds at the Augusta National Golf Club. Having come into the event with a series of strong performances last year, the 43-year-old great feel upbeat about his form and looks to some emphatic finish at the Masters. "I feel like I can win," Woods said during a press conference on Tuesday. "I've proven that I can do it and I put myself there with a chance to win the last two major championships of the year last year. I was right there and just needed to have a couple more things to go my way. I've worked my way back into one of the players that can win events." Woods' biggest challenge is still the physical limitation on practice time. He can't just work on every aspect of the game from sunrise to sunset anymore. He said he has to take it one segment at a time. "I just can't log in the time that I used to, and that goes with every part of my game," Woods said. "I can't work on every single part of my game every day. I have to pick different parts of my game to work on, and that's the challenge I now face going forward. Just have to figure it out and try to create a good balance there to find a prep of what I need to work on. It was a little bit easier when I could work on everything, but that's no longer the case right now."
