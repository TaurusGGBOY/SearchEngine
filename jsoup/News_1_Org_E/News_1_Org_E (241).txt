GUIYANG, April 10 (Xinhua) -- Southwest China's Guizhou Province will strive to develop a clean and efficient electricity industry, the provincial energy administration said Wednesday. The province said that it aims to achieve 200 billion yuan (30 billion U.S. dollars) of output value in this field. To promote the development of clean and efficient power industry, Guizhou will improve the efficiency of existing coal power facilities, speed up energy conservation and emission reduction, and accelerate the development of both coal and power industries. In 2019, Guizhou will attempt to upgrade 1.8 million kW of coal-fired facilities to realize ultra-low emissions, while 3 million kW of coal-fired facilities are expected to accept energy-saving reconstruction. The administration said the province would speed up the development of hydropower projects and increase the province's hydropower capacity. In addition to hydropower, Guizhou will further develop renewable energy, including wind and solar power. The province aims to add more than 500,000 kW of power in 2019 produced by non-hydro renewable energy.
