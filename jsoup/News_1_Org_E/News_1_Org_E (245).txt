BUDAPEST, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Hungarian runners won the 12th Lake Balaton Supermarathon in both men's and women's categories after running 196 kilometers in four days. The official results published here on Sunday showed that runners had to cover 48 kilometers each day since Thursday. In the men's category, Szabolcs Breda finished the race in under 13 hours 32 minutes and 50 seconds, while the fastest female athlete was Lilla Cseke, who ran under 15:17:02. "Both athletes have triumphed each day under each marathon," the organizers announced on the their official website. The silver and the bronze medals were also taken home by Hungarian runners in the tournament that saw a total of 2680 runners compete from 26 different countries and regions. The weather was dry and mild during the four days of the competition, with temperatures reaching 20 degrees on Saturday. Runners could choose to compete as individuals, in pairs, and even in teams of three and four. For those who don't want to run four days in a row, there was the option since 2011 to run "only" two marathons in two days or one marathon in one day. Winners of the 2-day competitions were also Hungarians: Daniel Margull in the men's category with 6:46:49, and Zsuzsanna Maraz in the women's race with 7:41:31. The running course leads on a bicycle path and small roads around Hungary's most famous lake, the Lake Balaton, which is a favorite tourist spot for Hungarians and foreign tourists alike, with its crystal-clear, turquoise waters, and many traditional Hungarian restaurants offering local meals and wine.
