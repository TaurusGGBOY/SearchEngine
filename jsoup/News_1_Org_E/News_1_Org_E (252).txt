JAKARTA, March 18 (Xinhua) -- Indonesia has permanently banned Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft from serving in Indonesian airspace, following the notice issued by Federal Aviation Administration (FAA), Indonesian Minister of Transportation Budi Karya Sumadi said here on Monday. The official said the ban has taken effect since Thursday after the FAA issued Continuous Airworthiness Notification to the International Community (CANIC). The permanent ban was based on the evaluation on the existing Boeing 737 Max 8 operated by national airlines and the FAA notice, the minister said. "Lion Air and Garuda Indonesia have agreed to ground operation of their (Boeing 737 Max 8) planes," the minister said at the parliament building. The crash of a Lion Air jet in October killed 189, while the Ethiopian Airlines crash that occurred on March 10 killed 157 people aboard. The permanent ban was an upgrade from the previous temporary ban ordered by the ministry. During the temporary ban, all related aviation agencies were ordered to examine Boeing 737 Max 8 planes operated by national airlines to assure flight safety. Under the temporary ban, the authorized inspectors would grant permission for the aircraft which are declared fit to serve.
