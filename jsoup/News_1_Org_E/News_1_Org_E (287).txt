WASHINGTON, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Petra Kvitova of the Czech Republic defeated Caroline Garcia of France to book her spot into the women's singles quarterfinals at the Miami Open on Monday. Kvitova put on a dominating performance at the Center Court, raining down 26 winners against Garcia and weathering a two-hour-long rain delay en route to a comfortable 6-3, 6-3 victory. A shaky first service game from Garcia gave an early break to Kvitova, who backed it up to start the match with a 2-0 lead. Kvitova continued to keep the pressure on Garcia's serve and broke again to clinch the first set with confidence. Kvitova continued her momentum in the second set, breaking Garcia again for a 3-1 lead. A rain delay at 5-2 halted Kvitova's momentum, with Garcia poised to serve to try to stay in the match. About two hours later, upon resumption, she posted a strong hold to love but it wasn't enough to spark a turnaround as Kvitova quickly served out the match in straight sets.
