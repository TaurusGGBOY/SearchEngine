WASHINGTON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- The LA Lakers have parted ways with coach Luke Walton, General Manager of the franchise Rob Pelinka announced on Friday. "We would like to thank Luke for his dedicated service over the last three years," Pelinka said. "We wish Luke and his family the best of luck moving forward." Luke Walton was the assistant coach of the Golden State Warriors when they won the NBA championship in 2015. He worked as an interim coach when Steve Kerr was sidelined due to health issues in the following season before named head coach of the Lakers in April 2016. "I want to thank Jeanie Buss and the Buss family for giving me the opportunity to coach the Lakers," Walton said. "This franchise and the city will always be special to me and my family." In his three-year spell with the 16-time championship winners, the Lakers improved every year from the franchise worst 17-65 record in the 2015-2016 season, but still not enough to end the playoff drought since 2013. The Lakers fans saw hopes this year with LeBron James joining on a blockbuster move, but injuries stepped in the way and the Lakers was eventually shut out of the playoff zone, finishing 10th with a 37-45 record. The announcement came only three days after Magic Johnson stepped down as the organization's president of basketball operations, which is rumored about his decision to fire Luke Walton. According to ESPN reporters Andrian Wojnarowski, former Cleveland Cavaliers coach Tyronn Lue is leading the candidates for the empty post.
