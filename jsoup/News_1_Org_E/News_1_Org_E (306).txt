SYDNEY, March 25 (Xinhua) -- An elite organized crime task force in Australia released details on Monday of a bizarre crime raid that not only uncovered cash and stolen goods, but also a crocodile. Investigators from Strike Force Raptor charged a 24-year-old man in Sydney on Friday, who they alleged has ties to an outlaw motorcycle gang. Charged with "four counts of dealing with property suspected of being the proceeds of crime, two counts of possessing a motor vehicle or vessel" and one count of "dealing in protected animals" while not having a Wildlife Exhibitors Licence, the man was granted "strict bail conditions" and will appear in court next month, a statement from New South Wales State Police said. As well as the freshwater crocodile, other items that were seized during the raid included an undisclosed amount of "cash, a Mercedes Benz sedan, two Yamaha trail motorcycles and a jet ski." Police alleged all of these goods were stolen and added their investigation into this strange case is "ongoing."
