LONDON, March 21 (Xinhua) -- American superstar Beezie Madden, bidding a hat-trick of titles, will have to fight off tenacious challenge from Switzerland's Martin Fuchs and Clooney at the upcoming Longines FEI Jumping World Cup Final at Gothenburg, Sweden, on April 3. Madden, one of only five female athletes who have taken the title in the 40-year history is tipped to be a favourite to retain her title. The first of her two previous wins was recorded in Gothenburg. Fuchs, who won the individual silver medalistat with Clooney in last year's World Equestrian Games, will be helped by fellow Swiss Steve Guerdat, who took bronze in Tryon and won two World Cup titles with two different horses under his belt. And he posted the second of those two victories in the Scandinavium Arena three years ago. A total of 35 athletes from 18 countries and regions will compete in the 41st finale to the prestigious series that began way back in 1978 and the title-decider returns to the Swedish city this year for the 15th time. World No. 12 Henrik von Eckermann is hopeful of becoming the first Swedish rider to win the champion because he finished third with Toveks Mary Lou in both 2017 and 2018 and right now the two of them are on fire. The formidable partnership played a key role in Sweden's team silver success at the World Equestrian Games and have maintained form ever since. Germany will have three former champions. Ludger Beerbaum, who provided the first-ever German victory with the legendary Ratina Z in Gothenburg in 1993, will be joined by 2014 champion Daniel Deusser and 2011 winner Christian Ahlmann, both armed with great horses after enjoying an impressive qualifying season. The countries that will be represented at this year's Final are Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, Egypt, Estonia, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland, United Arab Emirates and the United States.
