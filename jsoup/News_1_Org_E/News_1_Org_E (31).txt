More than 110 countries and international organizations, as well as over 120 non-official exhibitors, have confirmed participation, which will make it the highest attendance in the expo's history. According to the organizer, the exhibition's service group had 4,000 staff on duty Saturday to provide operation management, reception, and tourist and security services. All 78 entrances to the exhibition were opened with 30 electric vehicles shuttling guests to and from the parking lot.
