WINDHOEK, March 22 (Xinhua) -- Namibian Basketball Federation (NBF), together with the International Basketball Federation (FIBA) and the International Basketball Foundation (IBF), will host the first ever Mini-Basketball Convention in Windhoek on April 11-13. The organizers said Friday it will also be the first ever Mini-Basketball Convention in Southern Africa. Some 30 African countries are expected to attend the convention. "A total of 250 children from the Namibia Basketball School League (NBSL) and some local schools from ages 7-12 will take part in this Mini-Basketball Convention. School league coaches and teachers from Namibia are invited to attend as this is a project that FIBA would like to implement all around Africa to grow the basketball movement," NBF Secretary General Ramah Mumba said. Mumba added that through the symposium, NBF hopes to ensure the legacy of the project and to stimulate the movement in the countries that had few activities so far. It is envisaged that the convention will promote and stimulate playful grassroots basketball for children aged between seven and 12 of both genders in line with the FIBA strategy. The strategy aims to use basketball for good activities for kids and parents adjusted to local needs and finally to support and create local structures. Enditem
