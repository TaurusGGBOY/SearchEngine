BEIJING, March 24 (Xinhua) -- More efforts are expected to be made to promote foreign-related legal service development in Beijing, according to the Beijing Lawyers Association. The association said it would help set up training systems aimed to introduce more talent to foreign-related legal services, in response to a recent survey report that shows several shortcomings in such services provided in the capital. The report, released by the All China Lawyers Association Wednesday, is based on a survey covering Beijing's top 900 law firms. It shows that many lawyers do not have sufficient knowledge of foreign laws or have difficulties with smoothly handling legal issues in foreign languages, though the majority of those surveyed can speak English. Due to their lack of basic knowledge about different industries, many lawyers struggle to offer useful proposals to help their customers with risk control or other issues, the report says. The Beijing Lawyers Association said it expected to see the range of foreign-related legal services expanding, and would carry out surveys to learn about the demands of Chinese enterprises operating overseas on legal services.
