LONDON, April 16 (Xinhua) -- More than 100 people have been arrested for blocking roads in ongoing climate change protests in London Tuesday. A police order came into force restricting demonstrations to a site at Marble Arch, after the first day protests caused widespread disruption. However, groups lingered at other major sites including Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square. The police said so far 55 bus routes were closed and 500,000 people affected as a result. A total of 122 people had been arrested by 12:30 BST on Tuesday. Most of the arrests were for breaching the order instructing protesters to stay at Marble Arch. Three men and two women were held on suspicion of criminal damage after protesters vandalised the energy company Shell's headquarters on Monday. Chief Superintendent Colin Wingrove of the Metropolitan Police said: "Ongoing demonstrations are causing serious disruption to public transport, local businesses and Londoners who wish to go about their daily business...We have significant resources in place to deal with any incidents that may arise." The protests, organized by British climate group Extinction Rebellion, started Monday across London, with thousands of protesters blocking roads in London landmarks including Waterloo Bridge, Marble Arch, Parliament Square, Oxford Circus and Piccadilly Circus. It has three core demands: for the government to "tell the truth about climate change", reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025, and create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. The group said protests would continue throughout the week "escalating the creative disruption across the capital day by day". The British climate group, which was founded last year, claimed the demonstrations are part of a global campaign with protests planned in 80 cities across 33 countries and regions in the coming days. Critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.
