LISBON, April 13 (Xinhua) -- Portugal has expressed willingness to host up to 10 of the 64 migrants stranded in the Mediterranean Sea, the Portuguese Ministry of Internal Administration said on Saturday. In a statement, the ministry said that it had already conveyed the intention to the government of Malta, following the cooperation agreement reached between Portugal, Germany, France and Luxembourg, with the coordination of the European Commission. Portugal is "taking on its commitment to solidarity and European cooperation in the field of migration by actively participating in all reception processes," said the statement. The Portuguese government "continues to defend an integrated, stable and permanent European solution to meet the migratory challenge," the statement said. European Commissioner for Migration, Home Affairs and Citizenship Dimitris Avramopulos, on his twitter account, welcomed the agreement reached by Portugal, Germany, France and Luxembourg to host the 64 migrants. The ship, of the German aid organization Sea-Eye, had been "stuck" for several days in the Mediterranean, with no port to dock after both Italy and Malta refused to allow the entry of 64 migrants -- 50 men, 12 women and 2 children.
