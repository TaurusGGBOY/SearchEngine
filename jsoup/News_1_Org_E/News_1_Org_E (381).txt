BUENOS AIRES, April 7 (Xinhua) -- A late Juan Cavallaro strike handed Tigre a 3-2 away victory over River Plate on the final day of the Superliga Argentina season on Sunday. In a frenetic finish, Diego Morales put the visitors ahead with nine minutes remaining after teammate Lucas Janson canceled out Roberto Rojas' opener. Rojas struck again in the 86th minute to square the ledger before Cavallero lashed in the winner after latching onto a Diego Morales pass three minutes later. The result did not prevent Tigre from being relegated to Argentina's second division, a fate that also befell San Martin de Tucuman, San Martin de San Juan and Belgrano. River finished the season in fourth place, guaranteeing the Buenos Aires giants a berth in next year's Copa Libertadores along with champions Racing Club, Defensa y Justicia and Boca Juniors. In other matches on Sunday, Huracan beat Atletico Tucuman 2-0, Independiente overcame Rosario Central 2-1, San Martin defeated Talleres Cordoba 2-1, Belgrano won 1-0 at home to Godoy Cruz and Patronato beat Argentinos Juniors 2-1.
