PARIS, March 24 (Xinhua) -- Norway's Johannes Thingnes Boe extended his record of wins in a single season to 16, also finishing a sweep of all men's titles on offer in biathlon World Cup on Sunday. Boe registered a perfect shooting performance to complete the season-ending men's 15km mass start race in 37 minutes and 25.6 seconds in Olso. The Norwegian added the latest mass start globe to his already overall, sprint, pursuit and individual globes. "I do the results but the team works together, the wax team and my coaches. I work really good with them. My teammates push me in the summer and the winter, so it is a great team victory," he told the International Biathlon Union (IBU) website. Arnd Peiffer of Germany also shot clean to finish runner-up at 19.2 seconds behind. His fellow German Benedikt Doll rounded out the podium at 38 seconds back with two penalties. Sweden's Hanna Oeberg triumphed the women's 12.5km mass start competition in 35 minutes and 56.2 seconds, just 1.3 seconds ahead of hosts biathlete Tiril Eckhoff. The win also gifted Oeberg the mass start globe. Clare Egan of the United States had first career podium finish at 10.4 seconds back. Despite finishing 12th on Sunday, Dorothea Wierer of Italy maintained her lead atop the standings to claim the overall globe ahead of the 11th-ranked compatriot Lisa Vittozzi.
