RIO DE JANEIRO, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Two-time Brazilian Serie A champions Botafogo sacked head coach Ze Ricardo on Friday following a poor run of results. The decision came less than a day after Botafogo lost 2-1 to Juventude, a result that eliminated the Rio de Janeiro side from the Copa do Brasil. "The club would like to thank the manager for his work, dedication and professionalism," Botafogo said in a brief statement. Ricardo led Botafogo to 17 wins, 11 draws and 13 losses after taking charge last August. Among the candidates to replace the 47-year-old are former Cruzeiro boss Marcelo Oliveira and Jair Ventura, the son of Brazil 1970 World Cup winner Jairzinho. Ventura has already been Botafogo's coach once before, having held the position from August 2016 to December 2017. The Brazilian Serie A season begins on April 27.
