BRATISLAVA, April 11 (Xinhua) -- Slovakia ice hockey team lost 2-1 in the first game of their two-game friendly against Germany here on Thursday. With the 2019 Ice Hockey World Championship drawing near, the national team of Slovakia has entered the final stage of preparations. Two games against Germany on their home ice shall make it easier for coach Craig Ramsay to select the final roster for the championship. Slovakia's Matus Sukel scored the first goal of the match, which is also his first for the national squad, only 30 seconds into the game. But Germany took matters in their own hands for the rest of the clash and secured a 2-1 win thanks to a dominant second period. Stephan Dachsner put one past Slovakia's goalkeeper Julius Hudacek during a five-on-three power play and Marc Michaelis sealed the victory for the home team one minute before the second buzzer with a swift shot from the right side. Slovakia tried to even up the score in the last period, but failed to capitalize on two power plays. Germany's goalie Mathias Niederberger even withstood the final assault when Slovakia pulled their goalkeeper. The two teams will play their second friendly on Saturday.
