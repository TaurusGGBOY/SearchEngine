LONDON, April 12 (Xinhua) -- Manchester United coach Ole Gunnar Solskjaer on Friday said that he has no doubt in the commitment of 29-year-old midfielder Ander Herrera to the club, despite the fact he has still to sign a new contract. Herrera's current five-year deal expires at the end of June and he recently said he and the club were "not thinking alike" over talks for a new deal. The former Athletic Club Bilbao player picked up a muscle injury on March 30th, although speaking to the press ahead of Saturday's Premier League game at home to West Ham, Solskjaer said he hoped to have Herrera available again by April 24th or 28th. "He has been working really hard to get fit from his injury, which he sustained against Liverpool. Then he came back and he got a different injury in training. He has been really putting a lot of work in," said the Manchester United coach. Solskjaer admitted Herrera's injury had come at the wrong time. "Unfortunately that has come at a time when there are contract talks but that is ongoing so I cannot really comment too much on how far they have come down the line and what he is deciding." "I don't know how the last few talks have been," added the coach, who said he preferred to focus on Herrera's fitness. "He loves to play and he is not very happy when he cannot help his team-mates. He has always given his all. It does not matter if he has got five years left of his contract or five weeks," he concluded.
