WINDHOEK, April 6 (Xinhua) -- Alex Malete, assistant coach of the Botswana women team, said that his team can still beat Namibia in their return leg of the Africa Olympic Games Women qualifiers scheduled for Tuesday, April 9, 2019 in Namibia's capital Windhoek. The two neighbouring countries will meet for the second time, following Botswana's 1-0 win over Namibia in the first leg on April 5 in Botswana. The winnerS of the two leg tie will play South Africa in August this year with the date and venue yet to be decided. The winner between South Africa will qualify to the 2020 Olympics Games in Tokyo. Both Namibia and Botswana have never qualified for the Olympics Games, while South Africa were at the 2016 Olympics Games held in Rio, Brazil. Speaking on Saturday, Malete said that he is aware of Namibia's threat in the return leg but said that his team will have to be fully focus for 90 minutes if they are to get something out of the match. "We know that Namibia will do everything to get a goal because that is the only way they (Namibia) can have a chance of progressing to the next round. We know that it is not over and we are going to give our best in the last 90 minutes," Malete said.
