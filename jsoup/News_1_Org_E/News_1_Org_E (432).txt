DAMASCUS, March 27 (Xinhua) -- The Syrian air defenses responded to Israeli airstrike in Syria's northern province of Aleppo overnight Wednesday, intercepting a number of missiles before reaching their targets, according to the state news agency SANA. The airstrike targeted the Sheikh Najjar area in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo, according to the report, citing a military statement. Sounds of explosions were heard around the government-controlled area of Sheikh Najjar, which is an industrial zone in the northeastern countryside of Aleppo, said the report. The report said the attacks left damages only. Meanwhile, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights war monitor said the explosions occurred in weapon depots of the Syrian army and its allies between the international airport of Aleppo and the Sheikh Najjar zone. Israel has repeatedly targeted arm depots around the capital Damascus over pretext that the depots belong to Iranian-backed militias.
