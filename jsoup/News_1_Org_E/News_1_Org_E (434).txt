MONTEVIDEO, March 28 (Xinhua) -- Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez said Thursday that he has almost decided upon his squad for the Copa America in Brazil. The Celeste have been drawn in Group C alongside Chile, Ecuador and Japan for the continental tournament, which begins on June 14. "We already have something defined ... and anything else will be a matter of details or circumstances," Tabarez told reporters at Montevideo's international airport after returning from the China Cup, which Uruguay won courtesy of a 4-0 victory over Thailand in the final. Tabarez said the friendly tournament in China - in which Uruguay also beat Uzbekistan 3-0 - provided him with a valuable chance to test his squad in the absence of injured strikers Luis Suarez and Edinson Cavani. Among those to impress was Penarol full-back Giovanni Gonzalez, who made his debut against Uzbekistan. "It [the China Cup] was very useful because it allowed us to observe players who had not had many opportunities [with the national team] and some who debuted. The balance was positive," Tabarez added.
