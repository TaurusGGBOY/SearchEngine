BEIJING, March 28 (Xinhua) -- The Taiwan issue is China's internal affairs that concerns China's core interest and Chinese people's national feelings and brooks no foreign interference, a spokesperson of Ministry of National Defense said here Thursday. The spokesperson, Wu Qian, said at a press conference that China "resolutely opposes" the United States' recent moves on the Taiwan issue concerning arms sales to and military relations with the island. "The one-China principle is the commonly accepted norms of international relations and also the political foundation for China-U.S. relations," Wu said. Any word or act violating the one-China principle will shake the foundation of China-U.S. relations, is against the fundamental interests of both countries and "extremely dangerous," he said.
