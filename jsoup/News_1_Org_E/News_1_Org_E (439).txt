WINDHOEK, April 4 (Xinhua) -- A show by American vocal group The Temptations, which is scheduled for Saturday in Windhoek, has been postponed, the promoter said Thursday. The show dubbed "Motown Afro Night", would have seen the Temptations, who released a series of successful singles and albums with Motown Records during the 1960s and 1970s, grace Namibia with good old music, supported by Namibian artists. "The decision was taken after matters beyond our control could not be resolved between the promoters being Tshepi Live Entertainment-Botswana and the artists," the promoters announced. The promoters, Lucky Sky Travel and Tshepi Live Entertainment, said after careful thought and consideration of all the possible outcomes, as a result, the show cannot take place at the proposed date. "We would like to give our gratitude to all parties who rendered their contribution in support of this event. We hope to bring the Temptations in the future," they added. Meanwhile, Lucky Sky Travel Namibia branch as the facilitator and sponsor of the event is reported to be tasked to issue full refunds to everyone who has already bought tickets. The Temptations was the first Motown recording act to win a Grammy Award for "Cloud Nine" in 1969 and in 2013 received the Grammy Lifetime Achievement Award.
