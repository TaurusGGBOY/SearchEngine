RIO DE JANEIRO, March 21 (Xinhua) -- Brazil's former President Michel Temer was arrested on Thursday in a corruption investigation, according to local media. The arrest was ordered by Judge Marcelo Bretas, who is in charge of the Operation Car Wash investigations on corruption in the government. Temer, the predecessor of current President Jair Bolsonaro, left office last year. The police reportedly also seek Moreira Franco, who served as Minister of Mines and Energy in the Temer government, and Eliseu Padilha, who served as Temer's Chief of Staff. It remains unclear which particular accusation Temer is being arrested for, as he was charged in several cases. Temer is the second Brazilian president that has been arrested for corruption, following Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who is currently serving a 12-year-and-one-month prison sentence for corruption and money laundering.
