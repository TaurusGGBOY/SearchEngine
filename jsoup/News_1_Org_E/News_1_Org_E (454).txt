TUNIS, March 20 (Xinhua) -- On the 63rd anniversary of Tunisia's independence day, President Beji Caid Essebsi urged Wednesday the political class to bear responsibilities to solve "the real problems of the country". "The political class must show responsibility," said Tunisian president on Wednesday during a ceremony held at the Carthage Palace in the presence of many ministers, political leaders and members of civil society. According to the president, the celebration of March 20 is an opportunity to recall the "enormous sacrifices" made by the Tunisian people in all the crises experienced by the country, especially since national unity has succeeded in overcoming difficulties. "The political disagreement does not serve the interest of Tunisia; it complicates the situation," he said.
