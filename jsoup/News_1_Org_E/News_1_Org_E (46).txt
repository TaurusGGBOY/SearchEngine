LONDON, March 22 (Xinhua) -- A series of health projects, which aim to transform outcomes for patients through new technology, have received funding from the Biomedical Catalyst program, the UK Research and Innovation (UKRI) announced on Friday. The Biomedical Catalyst program is jointly run by Innovate UK and the Medical Research Council, both of which are parts of UKRI. Nine early stage projects have received total funding of almost 7.5 million pounds (about 9.9 million U.S. dollars). These include a new software which enables radiologists to diagnose breast cancer more effectively. Meanwhile, 15 feasibility projects have received a total funding of just over 2 million pounds (around 2.6 million U.S. dollars). In the latest round of awards, the MRC also committed a significant amount of funding to other medical projects. The success of the Catalyst's funding schemes shows the value of dedicated support in the development of therapies, diagnostics and devices that will benefit both patients and Britain's economy, said Louise Jones, head of translational research at the MRC.
