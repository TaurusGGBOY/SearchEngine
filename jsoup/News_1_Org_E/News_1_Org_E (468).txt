UNITED NATIONS, April 11 (Xinhua) -- The United Nations and the Iranian Red Crescent (IRC) society are working to provide assistance to those in need among the 10 million people affected by heavy rains and flash flooding in Iran, a UN spokesman said on Thursday. Published reports said scores of people have died in the flooding that began in late March. "The UN is working in coordination with relevant authorities who are leading the response," said Stephane Dujarric, spokesman for UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. "The IRC has provided assistance to more than 330,000 people in need," he said, while the United Nations has "provided assistance worth 1.4 million U.S. dollars for shelter, non-food Items, health and water and sanitation." "Efforts are underway to mobilize additional humanitarian assistance for those affected," Dujarric added. "UN teams are conducting field visits to the impacted areas to assess critical needs and needed humanitarian responses to support those affected," he said. "According to initial reports, over 54,000 homes have been destroyed and another 90,000 damaged." "Iran is under water," Sayed Hashem, regional director of the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, said on the federation's website. "This is an uNPRecedented crisis that has now touched at least 23 of Iran's 31 provinces." "While the precise impact is still to be seen, it is already very clear that the floods have caused extensive damage and suffering in villages, cities and rural areas," he said.
