NANNING, China, March 25 (Xinhua) -- Head coach Hector Cuper said Uzbekistan still have a lot of things to do despite beating China 1-0 to finish third at the China Cup here on Monday. "In general, I am content with the performance shown by my guys, but still there are a lot of things needed to be improved," Cuper said. "One thing is that we had a lot of chances to score, but we could not convert our chances and it's probably one of the things which we must improve in the future." Midfielder Otabek Shukurov was seriously hurt in the third-place final against China. "Shukurov has a serious injury in his ankle and he can't play for at least two months according to our doctor," the coach said. Uzbekistan have one win and one loss in the tournament.
