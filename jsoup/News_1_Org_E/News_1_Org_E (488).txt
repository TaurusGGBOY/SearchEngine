CARACAS, April 2 (Xinhua) -- Venezuela's National Constituent Assembly (ANC) on Tuesday unanimously approved the revocation of parliamentary immunity for Juan Guaido, the National Assembly president and head of the opposition. ANC President Diosdado Cabello read the message sent by President of Venezuela's Supreme Court of Justice (TSJ) Maikel Moreno, who had asked the governing body to consider revoking Guaido's parliamentary immunity. The TSJ ruled on Monday that Guaido failed to comply with the order prohibiting him from leaving the country which was imposed in January.
