WASHINGTON, March 18 (Xinhua) -- The Golden State Warriors will have their top scorer Kevin Durant back in the field in the game against the San Antonio Spurs on Monday. Durant, who had missed the Warriors' last two games with a right ankle injury, is averaging 27.4 points per game this season in 65 games for the Warriors. In addition, newly added center Andrew Bogut will also play in the game. "I'm excited to play again," Durant said. "I'm looking forward to having another opportunity to get better." While Bogut and Durant will be in the mix, the Warriors will be without Andre Iguodala and DeMarcus Cousins. Iguodala is having a tooth problem. Cousins is suffering from a sore right foot. Enditem
