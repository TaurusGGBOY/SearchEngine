PARIS, March 22 (Xinhua) -- World Cup winner France kicked off their Euro 2020 qualifying campaign by winning 4-1 away to minnows Moldova in Group H on Friday. It took France just half of the match to seal their victory thanks to goals from Antoine Griezmann, Raphael Varane and Olivier Giroud. After Kylian Mbappe extended their advantage, Vladimir Ambros scored a late consolation goal for the 170th-ranked hosts. Griezmann had a well-timed connection with Paul Pogba before sweeping home in the 24th minute, and teed up center back Varane's header through a corner three minutes later. Giroud met Blaise Matuidi's left-flank cross to register his 34th international goal in the 36h minute. The Chelsea forward has joined David Trezeguet as France's third all-time leading scorers, just behind Thierry Henry (51) and Michel Platini (41). The reigning world champions continued their dominance after the restart. Mbappe scored their fourth goal of the night with three minutes remaining. But the visitors failed to finish a clean sheet, as Ambros was on position to hit a rebound at target in the final minute. France will take on Iceland at the Stade de France next Monday.
