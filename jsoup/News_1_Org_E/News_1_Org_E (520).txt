BEIJING, March 31 (Xinhua) -- An article by Xi Jinping, general secretary of the Communist Party of China (CPC) Central Committee, on upholding and developing socialism with Chinese characteristics will be published Monday in the seventh issue of the Qiushi Journal this year. Xi, also Chinese president and chairman of the Central Military Commission, stressed in the article that path is the top issue concerning the success or failure of the Party's cause. "Path is the life of the Party." Socialism with Chinese characteristics is the only path to building a moderately prosperous society in all respects, speeding up socialist modernization and realizing national rejuvenation, the article said. "Both history and reality have told us only with socialism can we save China, and only with socialism with Chinese characteristics can we develop China," it said. "This is the conclusion of history and the choice of the people." Upholding Marxism and socialism must take a perspective of development, the article noted. All Party members and officials at all levels "must continuously deepen reform and opening up and advance theoretical, practical and institutional explorations," it said. It also called on CPC members, particularly officials, to have a deep belief in and faithfully practice Communism and socialism with Chinese characteristics.
