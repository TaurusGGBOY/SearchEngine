KUWAIT CITY, April 7 (Xinhua) -- Yemen hopes that Kuwait could contribute to its economic recovery, Khaled al-Yamani, the Yemeni foreign minister, said on Sunday in Kuwait City, capital of Kuwait. The Yemeni minister is paying an official visit to Kuwait. At a press conference held in Kuwait City on Sunday, he said that Kuwait has always been a strong advocate of the interests of the Arab nation in all international forums. "Kuwait has provided more than 2 billion U.S. dollars in aid for humanitarian plans at the United Nations where Kuwait is one of the largest contributors. We seek that Kuwait could contribute to support economic recovery and small projects of Yemen," he said.  "Kuwait has always been a supporter of Yemen," he said, adding that Kuwait has been and continues to support the Yemeni people in all the development work where every hospital and school built in Yemen was with the contribution of Kuwait. About the peace deal, reached by Yemeni warring parties in December last year in Stockholm, the minister pointed out that if Yemen gets out from the path of the United Nations, it will make people lose hopes. "The Stockholm Agreement has international acceptance and commitments, but the Houthis have killed the agreement signed by the Yemeni government in Sweden last December," he noted.
