SAITAMA, Japan, March 18 (Xinhua) -- After a long day's wait, Japanese star skater Yuzuru Hanyu finally showed up at the Tokyo International Airport, skipping the two practices on the first day of the ISU Figure Skating World Championships here on Monday. Hanyu didn't not show up in the morning practice, neither did his two teammates Keiji Tanaka and Olympic silver medalist Shoma Uno. But Tanaka and Uno took part in the second practice. Japanese media outlets "Daily Sports" and "Nikkan Sports" reported that Hanyu had just reached the Tokyo International Airport around 7:00 in the evening. Hanyu is no doubt the hot favorite in Saitama, but his form is in doubt as he sat out the Grand Prix Final, Japanese nationals and Four Continents this season due to his right ankle injury. He had won the world championships twice in 2014 and 2017, while American Nathan Chen won the last edition without Hanyu. The tournament runs from March 18 to 24. The men's short program starts on Thursday.
