NDOLA, Zambia, April 16 (Xinhua) -- Chinese investments in Zambia's agricultural sector will enhance technology adoption in the country's farming industry, which will result in higher food productivity, a senior government official has said. Minister of Agriculture Michael Katambo said in an interview with Xinhua early this week that Zambia is partnering with foreign investors, especially the Chinese in the farming industry to improve national food production. "Our partnering with Chinese in agriculture sector will scale up investment in the farming industry in our country," he said, adding the Chinese have shown an interest in investing in the country's aquaculture sector. Katambo said Zambia should be turned into a regional food basket in the next few years because of the anticipated increase in investment. Agriculture sector is one of the major revenue generation contributors towards Zambia's economic growth, he added. The government, he said, has set aside 100,000 hectares of land across provinces to open up farming activities on a commercial basis. "We are encouraging all our private partners to help develop the undeveloped farming blocks across the country. We want to be a food basket in the southern region," he said. This, he said, can only be achieved when the agriculture sector engages in modern agriculture technology to enhance farming activities. According to him, the construction of multi-purpose dams such as Muwomboshi dam in Central province and Kafulafuta dam on the Copperbelt province will help harness water for improved irrigation activities. "Farmers will benefit a lot to grow food all year round through enhanced irrigation system," he said.
