GAZA, March 30 (Xinhua) -- At least four Palestinians were killed and 316 injured on Saturday during day-long clashes with Israeli soldiers in eastern Gaza Strip, close to the border with Israel, medics said. Gaza's health ministry said in a statement that Bilal al-Najjar, 17, was critically wounded earlier on Saturday and succumbed to his sustained wounds later at night.  Al-Najjar joined the protests and rallies in the east of Kahn Younis town, close to the border with Israel in southern Gaza Strip. Ashraf al-Qedra, health ministry spokesman in Gaza, said earlier said that Tammer Abu Al-Kheir, 17, was killed by Israeli soldiers' gunfire in his chest east of Khan Younis town in southern Gaza Strip, close to the border with Israel. "Four were killed and 316 injured, including 64 injured by live gunshots, 16 by rubber bullets and the rest by tear gas," said al-Qedra, adding that nine paramedics and four journalists were among the injuries. The fierce clashes marked the first anniversary of the rallies, better known as the "Great March of Return," and also 43 years for the Palestinian "Land Day." They waved Palestinian flags, chanted slogans against Israel and clashed with the Israeli soldiers, who were stationed on the border to prevent the masses of demonstrators from approaching the fence. The event's goal, according to the members of the High Commission of the "Great March of Return," is to end an Israeli blockade that had been imposed on the Gaza Strip since Hamas' violent takeover of the enclave in 2007.
