BUDAPEST, March 21 (Xinhua) -- The 12th Lake Balaton Supermarathon kicked off in Hungary on Thursday with more than 2,500 runners going on for the 196 kilometers in four days. The participants will run about 48 km each day, and the race will end on Sunday. The runners can choose to compete as individuals, in pairs, and even in teams of three and four. For those who don't want to run four days in a row, there is the option since 2011 to run "only" two marathons in two days or one marathon in one day: runners choosing two marathons can join the event only for the weekend, running the half of the set distance, thus a half circle around the lake. One can join the race and run a single marathon on Saturday to enjoy the views of the lake. The running course leads on a bicycle path and small roads around Hungary's famous lake, the Lake Balaton, which is a favorite tourists spot for Hungarians and foreign tourists alike, with its crystal-clear, turquoise waters, and many traditional Hungarian restaurants offering local meals and wine. On the first day, Szabolcs Breda, 42, finished first in 3 hours 13 minutes 40 seconds, and the fastest female was 36-year-old Lilla Cseke who clocked 3:38:56, according to the official results. Each participant receives a medal at the end of the fourth day.
