PHNOM PENH, March 26 (Xinhua) -- Cambodian Prime Minister Samdech Techo Hun Sen said on Tuesday that digital technology can drive growth and efficiency of local service delivery. Speaking at the opening ceremony of the annual Cambodia Outlook Conference under the theme "Digital Transformation towards Industry 4.0," Hun Sen said Industrial Revolution 4.0 is becoming an important catalyst for socio-economic development in Cambodia. "Digital technology can improve public sector capacity for the government, increase accountability and transparency in local service delivery, and assist government at all levels to reach more people," the prime minister said. It could also strengthen cooperation, partnership and innovation within ministry and inter-ministries and other relevant institutions across the country, he said. "To seize the full benefits from digital economy, Cambodia needs to put more efforts in order to promote strong and high economic growth for the long term," Hun Sen said. The one-day conference brought together some 350 participants, including government officials, national and regional experts, academics, and researchers as well as representatives of development partners, non-governmental organizations and private sector. The United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) also brought Artificial Intelligent Robot Sophia to the conference in order to showcase the development of digital technology and innovation. "With the rise of Industry 4.0, digital transformation could be the new growth engine that Cambodia needs to realize its long-term vision of becoming an upper-middle income country by 2030 and a high-income country by 2050," said Mey Kalyan, chairman of the Cambodia Development Resource Institute, which organized the conference.
