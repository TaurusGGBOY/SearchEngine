BEIJING, March 20 (Xinhua) -- China reiterated its stance on China-Africa cooperation on Wednesday, calling for more countries to think highly of Africa. Foreign Ministry spokesperson Geng Shuang made the remarks at a press briefing in response to the groundless accusations made against China's policy towards Africa, such as the Mombasa-Nairobi Standard Gauge Railway (SGR) Project in Kenya will put the country in debt. Geng cited Kenyan President Uhuru Kenyatta as saying that "in recent years, Kenya-China relations have become closer and closer, and cooperation between the two countries has become tighter in such fields as industry and infrastructure construction." The SGR is one of the most ambitious infrastructure projects in Africa and has brought great changes to the lives of the Kenyan people, the president said. Geng said China appreciates that the leaders of many African countries, including Djibouti and Kenya, and people of insight from all walks of life have a fair evaluation of China-Africa relations and China-Africa cooperation. China will intensify pragmatic cooperation in various fields with African countries under the Belt and Road Initiative, steadily implement the consensus reached by Chinese and African leaders and promote constant development of the China-Africa comprehensive strategic cooperative partnership. "We hope more countries will truly pay attention to Africa, attach importance to Africa, and invest in Africa, and work together with China to help Africa's peace, stability, development and prosperity," he added.
