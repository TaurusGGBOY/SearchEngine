BEIJING, April 7 (Xinhua) -- China saw 112 million domestic tourist trips during the three-day tomb-sweeping holiday, up 10.9 percent from last year's holiday, according to the Ministry of Culture and Tourism. The tourism revenue reached 47.9 billion yuan (about 7.1 billion U.S. dollars) during the holiday which lasts from Friday to Sunday, up 13.7 percent, according to the ministry. While tourists still favor sites of natural scenes, an increasing number of people chose to visit history museums, martyrs' memorial halls and memorial sites of revolution during the holiday, the ministry said in a report, adding that the online ticket sales at such spots across the country saw a year-on-year increase of 55.2 percent. The Tomb-sweeping Day, or Qingming Festival, is an important occasion for Chinese people to honor their ancestors. Many also spent the three-day holiday on leisure travel.
