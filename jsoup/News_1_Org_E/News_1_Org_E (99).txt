XI'AN, April 8 (Xinhua) -- China U16 men's soccer team swept Kyrgyzstan 6-0 on Monday for its second straight victory at the Silk Road Hua Shan Cup international youth football tournament. China who beat Myanmar 5-0 on Saturday, kept their winning mood by dominating the first half against Kyrgyzstan who opted to line up five defenders in a row after its earlier 8-0 loss to Tajikistan. After Ye Zimin missed his close volley in the 4th minute and captain Liu Yiheng swung his header over the bar seven minutes later, Jia Boyan of Shanghai SIPG found the net in the 41st minute with a power shot out of the box. Ye Zimin scored the second before the half time. Liu Yiheng made an easy goal to start the second half through a pass from Jia Boyan, and Chen Nuo made it 4-0 in six minutes. Ye Zimin scored his second with a header in the 55th minute before substitute Wang Tao completed the scoring spree in the extra time with a volley shot. "I am very happy that my players know how to attack, how to create chances. That is more important than the game result," said Puche Vicente Antonio, head coach of Team China. In the other game on Monday, Tajikistan beat Myanmar 5-0. China will vie against Tajikistan for the tournament trophy on April 10.
